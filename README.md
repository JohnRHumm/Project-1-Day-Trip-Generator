# Project-1-Day-Trip-Generator
First devCode project which will randomly create a trip consisting of a location, transportation, activity, and a place to eat.

Program will randomly select from 7 cities 
    1. Atlanta
    2. Boston
    3. Chicago
    4. Houston
    5. Kansas City
    6. Nashville
    7. Seattle
Each city has a list of 10 activites and 10 restaurants specific to that city. There is also a list of 10 methods of transportation within the city that is generic to all cities.

The user enters commands that are mainly Yes/No (y/n). 
Once all selections have been made the user has the option of changing any of the details of their trip, however, if they select a differenct city, they will get a new activity and restaurant (based on the city).

Once the user has agreed to all the details, they can finalize their trip and the final seleciton will be output to the console.
